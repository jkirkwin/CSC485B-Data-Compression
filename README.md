# CSC485B-Data-Compression
Coursework from CSC485B at UVic, a systems topics class focused on data compression.

All programming assignments were done in c++.

# Assignment 1 - `compress`
`uvcompress/` holds an implementation of the unix `compress` utility's encoder. 

# Assignment 2 - DEFLATE
`uvgz/` holds and implementation of the GZip encoder (using the DEFLATE algorithm).

# Assignment 3 - Custom compression pipeline
`uvzz/` holds an implementation of my own customized encoder and decoder.

# Assignment 4 - Image compression
`uvg/` holds an implementation of a JPEG-influenced DCT-based .bmp image compressor and decompressor.

# Assignment 5 - Video compression
`uvid/` holds an implementation of a very simple video (no audio or other metadata) codec, based on
the image codec mplemented in `uvg`.
